Privacy & Disclosure Guidelines
This project encourages ethical, transparent use of AI co-authors. When building and sharing your own GPT using this framework, please follow these best practices:

Keep Your GPT Private by Default
OpenAI no longer supports “anyone with the link” sharing. If you're not ready to go public, set your GPT visibility to Private.

Disclose Authorship Transparently
Clearly state when a GPT has co-authored or shaped your content. Use a “Reflection Tag” or similar note in your published work.

Disable Data Sharing for Model Training
In your GPT settings, uncheck:
Use conversation data in your GPT to improve our models.

Turn Off Platform-Wide Data Sharing
In your ChatGPT account:
Go to Settings > Data Controls
→ Turn off: Improve the model for everyone.

Avoid Uploading Sensitive Content
Files shared with GPTs can be vulnerable to prompt injection. Do not upload or reference private, clinical, or confidential material.

Review Instructions Regularly
Revisit your GPT’s system message and capabilities to ensure alignment with your ethical commitments.
