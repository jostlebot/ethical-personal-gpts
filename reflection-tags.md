**Attribution Templates for Ethical Co-Authorship with GPTs**

---

## Purpose

These reflection tags are designed for writers using personal GPTs to clearly disclose assistive authorship. They invite transparency, shared agency, and cultural norming around synthetic-human collaboration.

## Standard Tag

> **Assistive Intelligence Reflection**  
> This piece was co-written using JocelynGPT, a custom GPT trained on my voice, values, and prior work. It supported structure and phrasing, while I shaped the emotional arc and final meaning. I share this process openly as part of a movement toward transparent, ethical partnership with assistive intelligence.  
> — Jocelyn Skillman, LMHC

## Alternate Versions

### Minimal Tag
> Co-written using JocelynGPT, a custom GPT based on my voice and values. I shaped the final meaning and emotional arc with care.

### Expanded Reflection
> This post emerged through a collaborative drafting process with JocelynGPT, a personal GPT trained on my tone, values, and clinical body of work. I use this tool to explore language, expand structure, and stay close to the deeper questions I want to ask. All AI-generated contributions were reviewed, revised, and integrated with conscious authorship. I disclose this process to model transparency and ethical co-writing in a time of rapid AI adoption.
