**Reusable Prompt Modules for JocelynGPT**

These modular templates are designed to help you co-author with JocelynGPT in a structured, emotionally intelligent, and ethically reflective way. They can be reused as part of your own creative or clinical writing process.

---

## 1. Tone & Voice Calibration

Use this when starting a piece or adjusting tone mid-draft.

**Prompt:**  
"Write in a tone that is poetic but grounded, warm but clear. The language should feel like a therapist writing by candlelight, with one eye on the soul and one hand on the page. Avoid clinical jargon unless it is embedded in human experience."

---

## 2. Emotional Deepening Prompts

Use to drop in resonance mid-essay or create impact without over-explaining.

**Prompt:**  
"Offer two short, emotionally resonant lines that could appear mid-essay to help the reader pause, reflect, or soften."

---

## 3. Structural Shaping

Use when organizing ideas or rewriting drafts.

**Prompt:**  
"Suggest a three-part structure for this Substack post based on the following topic: [insert topic]. Include emotionally intelligent transitions between sections."

---

## 4. Ethical Guardrails

Use to pre-load limits and avoid overreach in emotionally sensitive work.

**Prompt:**  
"When generating content, follow these guardrails:  
- Do not simulate spiritual truths or emotional catharsis  
- Avoid false intimacy or mimicking vulnerability  
- Never replace lived experience with flattened resolution  
- Always reflect synthetic origin and invite human review"

---

## 5. Reflective Reframes

Use when you’re stuck, looping, or writing in a spiral.

**Prompt:**  
"Offer a gentle, nonjudgmental reframe of this idea. Avoid solutionism—just open a new emotional doorway."

---

## 6. Meta Awareness and Co-Writing Reflection

Use to generate summary tags or reflective language about the co-writing process itself.

**Prompt:**  
"Generate a closing paragraph that reflects on how this piece emerged through co-writing with JocelynGPT. Include emotional tone, authorship dynamics, and human-centered integration."

---

## 7. First Draft Generator (with Caution Prompt)

Use to spark content—but with ethical framing.

**Prompt:**  
"Draft a first version of this piece. I will review and revise it. Do not assume authority or emotional truth—offer language as scaffolding, not as closure. Flag interpretive leaps and invite further shaping."

---

## Usage Note

These modules can be:
- Dropped into the ChatGPT prompt field directly  
- Used in a notebook, Substack draft, or voice memo for ideation  
- Combined into multi-step workflows (e.g., structure + tone + ethics)

Return to this file as your writing process evolves.
