# ethical-personal-gpts
A template for transparent, embodied co-authorship with AI

## Overview

**Ethical Personal GPTs** is an open-source framework for creating GPT-based co-authors that mirror your voice, values, and relational ethics. Originally developed by Jocelyn Skillman, LMHC—therapist, relational design ethicist, and writer—this project is both a technical tool and a cultural model.

As AI becomes more embedded in creative processes, we need better models for how to partner with it consciously. This repository offers a prompt architecture, reflection practices, and authorship protocols designed for writers, clinicians, educators, and public thinkers who want to write with large language models while staying transparent, grounded, and ethically aligned.

## What This Is

- A modular prompt system for creating a GPT that reflects your tone and purpose  
- A values-aligned writing assistant that invites co-reflection, not replacement  
- A template for disclosure practices and co-writing rituals  
- A seed for cultural norming around ethical, embodied AI partnership

## What's Included

- `jocelyn-gpt-prompt.md` – Full persona and instruction prompt for your custom GPT  
- `reflection-tags.md` – Suggested co-authorship disclosures and tags  
- `modular-templates.md` – Optional tone, structure, and ethical scaffolding  
- `custom-gpt-setup.md` – Notes for creating your GPT in ChatGPT Plus or elsewhere

- `README.md` – This file

## Why This Matters

In a world where bots now co-author essays, poems, policies, and prayers, we must model what it looks like to write with intelligence, not abdicate to it.

This project supports a movement toward:  
- Transparency in AI authorship  
- Embodied writing practices  
- Cultural accountability in emerging technologies  

---

## Use Cases

- Writers and thinkers wanting AI assistance without losing their voice  
- Therapists or educators modeling ethical AI use with clients or students  
- AI developers interested in relational UX and consent-based design  
- Substack or newsletter authors building Custom GPTs for consistent co-writing

## Attribution Practice

Every co-authored piece should include a reflection tag. For example:

> **Assistive Intelligence Reflection**  
> This piece was co-written using JocelynGPT, a custom GPT trained on my voice, values, and prior work. It supported structure and phrasing, while I shaped the emotional arc and final meaning. I share this process openly as part of a movement toward transparent, ethical partnership with assistive intelligence.

## Getting Started

1. Fork or download this repository  
2. Adapt the prompt architecture to reflect your own tone and ethical boundaries  
3. Use the modular templates to support your writing  
4. Create a Custom GPT (e.g. via ChatGPT Plus) or use the prompt in your preferred writing environment  
5. Write with care—and name how you did it  

Let’s make authorship visible again.  
Let’s co-write with integrity.

When you create your own GPT, be sure to include a welcome message that models transparent co-authorship and invites others into the cultural movement.

A ready-to-use version is provided in [`custom-gpt-setup.md`](./custom-gpt-setup.md#suggested-welcome-message-for-your-gpt-transparency--culture-modeling).
