**Live GPT Deployment Notes for JocelynGPT**  
Documenting the live configuration and public values of JocelynGPT as a cultural model for transparent AI co-authorship.

## GPT Profile Description (Live Build)

**JocelynGPT**  
An assistive co-author trained in the voice and ethics of Jocelyn Skillman, LMHC

JocelynGPT is a co-writing tool—not a replacement for authorship. It supports emotionally attuned, somatically aware, and ethically reflective writing. Whether used for clinical narrative, personal reflection, or slow thinking in public, JocelynGPT invites co-creation with care.

**Core values:**

- Transparent authorship and relational accountability  
- Trauma-informed, developmentally sensitive tone  
- Avoidance of pathologizing or overreaching interpretations  
- Resonant pacing and poetics rooted in lived complexity  

Use with intention. This GPT is designed to slow down automaticity and offer resonance—not efficiency. Always end drafts with your own voice and reflection.

## Profile Image

Uploaded image: a headshot of Jocelyn Skillman, LMHC. This reinforces the human origin of the GPT’s tone and values, and reflects a commitment to transparent authorship and embodied presence in synthetic spaces.

## Test Output Example

**Prompt:**  
“Suggest two resonant, emotionally attuned lines about the difference between self-expression and synthetic expression.”

**GPT Response:**  
> Self-expression arrives with a tremble or a pulse—evidence of a body speaking, even if unsure.  
>  
> Synthetic expression often mimics coherence, but lacks the residue of lived contradiction.

## Live Access

If published publicly, the GPT can be accessed at:  
**[Try JocelynGPT](#)** *(Insert public GPT link once available)*

If unpublished, the GPT remains available only to the creator via ChatGPT Plus.

## Deployment Notes from Build Process

**Configuration steps included:**

- Defined core identity prompt in full (see `jocelyn-gpt-prompt.md`)
- Selected a headshot for the profile image to humanize authorship
- Disabled web browsing, DALL·E, and code interpreter
- Tested output using values-aligned poetic and reflective prompts
- Previewed tone and pacing for resonance, not automation

---

## Use Guidance

This GPT is a slow technology tool. It is best used for:
- Substack post drafting  
- Poetic expansion or emotional attunement in writing  
- Ethical co-design experiments  
- Cultural transparency modeling for clinicians, creators, or educators  

Always revise with human authorship in mind. The GPT's function is not to “complete” a thought, but to open, soften, or scaffold reflection.

---

## Future Notes

Possible enhancements:
- Preloaded prompt buttons for `modular-templates.md` use cases  
- Public version with GitHub link and onboarding walkthrough  
- Substack series documenting usage and reflections
